## Project Description
Spotify is a proprietary Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on 23 April 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 527 million monthly active users, including 210 million paying subscribers, as of March 2023. 

In this project I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Spotify data using Python(Jupyter Notebook). The analysis includes data exploration, data cleaning, data visualization, and deriving insights from the data. The scripts and notebooks in this repository cover different techniques and visualizations used in EDA.

The purpose of this EDA is to understand the data, discover patterns, identify anomalies, and derive meaningful insights that can inform decision-making or guide further analysis.

## Installation
To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed. 

The following libraries are used in this project: 

 Pandas : [https://pandas.pydata.org/] 
 
 NumPy : [https://numpy.org/install/] 
 
 Matplotlib : [https://matplotlib.org/] 
 
 Seaborn : [https://seaborn.pydata.org/] 

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [(https://www.python.org/downloads/)] Or you can use Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) : [https://www.anaconda.com/]

##  Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/Rupanavale/EDA-spotify-using-Python.git

2. Navigate to the specific dataset or analysis of interest.

3. Open the Python script or Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any Python IDE).

4. Execute the code cells or run the script to perform the EDA.

5. Explore the visualizations, summary statistics, and insights obtained from the analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from two Kaggle datasets which are as follows:
